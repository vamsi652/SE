In the context of linguistic harmony, we define a "harmonious string" as a string where every alphabet it contains appears both in uppercase and lowercase forms. For instance, a string like "pqQpP" is harmonious because it has both 'P' and 'p' as well as 'Q' and 'q'. Conversely, a string like "pqP" is not harmonious as it fails to meet this condition, with 'q' present while 'Q' is absent.

Your are given a string S, your task is  to return the longest harmonious substring in S. 
If there are multiple answers meeting this criterion, you should return the one that appears 
earliest in the string. If there is no harmonious substring, you should return an empty string.

Input Format:
-------------------
A string S

Output Format:
-------------------
Prin the longest harmonious string.

Factorial of N means, Product first N natural numbers.
e.g., N= 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N.

You are given an integer N, Your task is to find out the number of 0's 
at the end of the factorial value of N.

for example : N =5 => Factorial of 5 is 120.
0' s at the end of 120 are 1.

Constraint : 1<= N <= 10000

Input Format:
-------------
An integer N

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, number of 0's at the end.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
5

Sample Output-1:
----------------
1


Sample Input-2:
---------------
4

Sample Output-2:
